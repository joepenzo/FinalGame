	Make level more logic
		- platform sizes compared to objects like enemies and avatar, and open stops


	Fix bullets/shooting when enemy is big ( Bullets stop because of the size, they are fired from the inside of the avatar)


	Remove all enemies when percentage is 0 - some enemies stay in the level is % = 0


	Fix bullet direction change, on left or right key down
	
	Sometimes enemies fall of the ledge..
